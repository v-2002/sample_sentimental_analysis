"worst coustmer care support, I bought this phone on 7 days back, charger  not working and I rise the complete, they did not responding"
Adaptor is not in working condition
It's getting off automatically while picking any call
"Everything works super fine. Just like new . Completely clean and no sign of use .But the box was not neat and is looking old , but it doesn't matter. The piece i got is fine .👇But couldn't the sellers or amzon mention the condition of the specific one we are going to  purchase. Because we are spending money on it and we need to know the exact condition wheather it is only unboxed or it is minimaly used or if it is used, the specific damage if any etc.So that we could understand the condition."
Very worst
"Pros - cost effective solution to use android mobile, gorila galss body.Cons - too much hanging , poor finger sensor, mi not provide the actual mentioned RAM and ROM."
The worse product ever.I The seller put second hand battery and mother board in a finely seal packet.Suddenly my mobile not working after 18 days of buying.As warranty was there I gave the mobile to service center and from there I come to know the dark truth of new branded mobile.l was shocked and the return policy was only for 1 week. I searched customer service number but not got.My money fall in water.And I really disappointed with Amazon customer care executive for not providing the proper number of contact.Its not completed 1 months.😰😰Amazon wale kuch to kijiye🙏🙏🙏

"Sorry to say this but Am not satisfied with the product I received.I purchased on 25Nov2020, and in this 2 months i went to MI service center for 3 times. Because my mobile automatically rebooted everyday and sometimes switched off.Please can anyone help."
"I am writing it after using it for 1month, the charger has stopped working after using it for 1 week, now again I have to buy a new charger, such technology glitch is unacceptable."

back camera picture are not good as expected to 48mp and battery performance is not good
It's total fraud. I was unaware about the meaning of word Renewed. They supplied faulty product and becomes non functional within one month. And their authorise service center asking Rs 9000/- for repair the set. It's total fraud case.

"1. To start the Hotspot connection, sometimes I have to double click on the Hotspot button.2. When a device is connected to it and someone calls me, the hotspot turns off automatically."
"The phone worked fairly well for 2 years after which it started having problems. It recently became extremely laggy and it would sometimes hang when the camera app was open. I fixed this using a memory-cleaning app. After this, it now just shuts down randomly and gets stuck in a boot loop (won't restart on its own). The only way to let it start up is to connect the adapter and charge.  A google search showed that several other models of Redmi Note have reported this issue.These phones don't seem to have a long lifespan beyond 1 year or even 18 months.My first and last Redmi/Xiaomi phone."

What is you expect in this price segment you get better than that . Working fine without any disturbance. I am using in 6 month after i post this review. But now 5g phone are coming on similar price points try those .

".my friend Suggested me to Buy Redmi Note9 tho she was using nd quite impressed by perfomance .Nd I've seen my one cousin also using Redmi brand.nd that's perfomance was just  outstanding after 5year of rough use . So I decided nd bought this one in july2021.First i Impressed with look According to price .Arctic white gave Decent vibe.Storage is good it has alot of Space. Fingerprint sensor is Bestest.Camera is awesome at the price, have quite Mode for Good pics , nd it gives Best  click for Hd pics/ videos  ..once you charge  Battery you can use a whole day Backup is Good..But there is one issue it started hanging  after 4 months .nd this make me irritate ..maybe this model have issue coz my friends using same Brand but this never Happened"
"This phone is good. I am giving rating after using 1 year. Phone is durable, battery life is ok. Look and camera is also good but there is hanging problem in this. Some times google doesn't support. Sound is very less. It needs to reset when some of function doesn't work."

Good phone but I am recommending you not to purchase this phone because this phone is so old and I think in this price and we will find some new phones I am not saying that this phone is so bad are you should not purchase phone but I think that you will find some good phone then it because this phone is so old hand when I play BGMI in the phone it become so hot and my entire gaming experience is doomed. The camera is good enough but I personally say I don't like this camera and because of this camera I use gcam you can download gcam and see the difference between the original one and the gcam photo. But for my users I think this phone is good and was so I want to say one thing that this phone will not come with Android 12 main xiaomi will not provide redmi note 9 Android 12 update thank you when I I started phone and using from 2-3 days I noticed that the fingerprint sensor is not so good and sound like electric sound is coming from the fingerprint sensor display is good but sometime the phone is hanged

"1} Design - Design is really good looks and feels premium in hand a bit heavy @200gm but got used to within a day 😍2} Screen - Good quality IPS screen and viewing angles are also good. Enjoying online video content on this mobile and the punch hole camera doesn't bother any much , 90hz refresh screen would have been killer in this price ☑️3} Battery - Amazing battery life with 5020mAh battery with 22.5w fast charging easily lasts full working day with heavy usage 😍4} Dedicated SD card slot - This is really missed by a lot of people because every time when we change phone it becomes handy just to put the SD card with data in new phone without the hassle of transferring all data in to new phone 🤗5} Dedicated headphone jack - Headphone jack is just really handy I don't know why in recent trend big manufacturers are skipping to put a 3.5mm jack in phones even when they can easily fit it inside of the phone 👏🏼6} Type C charging - I always appreciate if smartphone is having Type c charging alot as most of phone recently have it 👌🏻7} Processor - Very powerful processor to handle daily tasks and performs very well with even 4GB Ram. Gaming experiance is good at medium setting but not the best in pubg 🔥8} Call quality - Call quality is also good never the recipient complaint about distortion or noise unless you are in very noisy environmentShould you buy : Yeah definitely , I am really happy with this phone in this price range and I recommend this phone to others ✅💯"

"Writing this review after 3 months of use, delivery by Amazon was super-fast, Redmi Note 9 looks good, camera quality is not that great though it's a 48 MP AI QUAD one but lacks quality pictures. Battery performance is fair, major problem with my phone is - it hangs regularly and becomes very slow at times. I would rather say Redmi 4 and Redmi 5 even perfomed better than Redmi Note 9. Don't suggest to buy this phone if you have moderate use of emails, phone calls and whatsapp messages."
"Camera:- Camera performance is average. Night camera is worst. Try to use pro mode in night to get good photos, otherwise pixel deteriorates like oil painting.48 MP camera is a lie, you can't use any filter on 48 MP camera. You can apply filter and all things on 12MP camera only.Weight:- Phone is bit heavy too.Battery:- Bettery lasts a day for normal uses. Charging time is around 70-90 minutes.Performance:- Performance is good. I've played COD on maximum graphics, but after 20-30 minutes phone starts getting heated.Others:- A lot of clutter needs to be cleared before using the phone.Overall phone is average on this 11k price range."

"This is my first Redmi phone, there are few points to be highlighted.Good-* Phone has big 6.53 size screen with full hd+ display.* Helio g85 gaming fast processor.* Big long lasting battery.* type c port, & IR blaster available.* Good looking phone like premium phones.* Quad camera with 48 mp / 16 mp front camera good performance.* Corning gorilla glass 5 protection.Bad-* 22.5 watt fast charger but very slow charging upto 2 & half hours to full charge.* No Super Amoled display* Android 10 o.s. presently 11 is used.* Back pannel is stunning but plastic.* Little heavy in hands weight around 200 gm.Overall a nice choice in this budget."

"Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy"
Camera need to improve
Have been using this phone from a month now and I can say that this is a good product with every thing decent but it's UI is a bit buggy and xaomi is really very lazy in sending updates.....and also if you can increase your budget just go for Redmi Note 10 it will be much better for you also during the phone setup you need to be very careful Regarding ads as xaomi has a tendency to send those useless ads in your phone. Lastly it's a good phone I can play CODM @ 40fps in medium high settings but if you can increase your budget just go for Redmi Note 10. Have a good day 😊

"The phone is a solid handset, albeit with a plastic body. Comes with the usual Xiaomi bloatware. You will get much better performance if you can remove these through an ADB tool. The G85 chip is no slouch and works well for daily usage. GCam on this phone bumps up low-light performance to unheard-of levels.Otherwise, the display is sharp, even though on the dimmer end at around 400 nits. Battery is huge, so should give you all-day usage.Plus, this has plenty of custom ROM support for enthusiasts to goose around the phone."

Very good phone with features.
After miuim12.5 update phone has become more smoother and faster.  Performance is very good. I got it at a price of rs10500 so it's value for money . For Daily use purposes with a good camera quality and a big screen it becomes a beast . But in the case of heavy gaming and battery life it's not so good as it's battery life is only about one to one and a half day... From my side it I recommended as I need it for study purposes.
"The fingerprint reader works well, battery is also good and overall the phone offers a good package at this range."
Thik hai
"I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should."
"Bought this coz nothing else was available as all phones are on selected sale dates.I got the mi ui 12 update on this, phone does show signs of sluggish behavior, after the update.There are many who have reported defects in the redmi note 9 series phones with related to camera accumulating dust and wifi issues,I have not got such issues yet, what i have faced is some touch issues on browser or while scrolling youtube, sometimes auto scrolls or blocks my scroll. started happening after the miui12 udpate.Battery draining faster after miui 12.Charger is 22 watts but phone is charging at 18 watt only, to be udpated by MI by software as per reports.it takes 2 hrs to fully charge.As far as phone is concerned, its ok , camera video quality is bad coz its not sturdy it keeps readjusting focus.It does click good pics.Day to day work on this phone was good, heavy mails would render and open faster. mi ui is customizable, you can hide the notch.There is no notification light.Processing is fast. but not a gaming phone .....period !!!!Pubg was sluggish and few others would crash. may be mediatek processor is not as good as snapdragon.Or that mediatek decided g85 was a stupid release and introduced 90 and 95 series.g85 doesnt have any upper hand to g80 in any aspect, so you could prefer redmi 9 prime or poco which is on g80 and 2k cheaper.Speaker volume is low and display is not that bright,Would not recommend to buy this, there are more options available."

"It's good for normal person you can borrow this yes, but for camera quality it's worst but phone's sensitivity is good for drag games like free fire and it's good ass well as it's fingerprint reader was good sometimes it stuck but it's good and battery life was medium means if it will ...,... it will be with you 100 to 10 battery time is... 2-3 hours if I am wrong so sorry but it means at your work what are you doing .. so that's allIt's good 👌"

Phone was good. But the camera Quality was not good enough. Even though it was 48MP. IT was working as 16MP.
Good looking phone
Excellent
Writting this review after 1month of proper usage.Don't expect an 48mp camera/picture Quality.Realme 3 pro's (13+5 mp) camera Quality is better than Redmi note 9's 48mp camera.It takes approximately 2hrs to full charge with the supplied 22.5w charger but when I spoke to mi customer care regarding the charging time they told me that it takes just 45min to get full charged but the battery life is excellent.The MIUI is laggy and within 1month of usage I have encountered many issues within MIUI to resolve the issue I need to restart the phone again&again.For day to day task the phone is good and screen quality is good.Fingerprint scanner is responsive.If camera is your priority then it is better to go with some other handset.Summing it up.Camera not goodScreen quality is goodIt is an bulky device.Takes long time to chargeBattery lasts long.Multitasking is ok.MIUI day to day usage is worst when compared to Realme UI.

 Satisfied with this purchase.Pros :1. Sensors are amazing....!!!  I haven't seen these kind of awesome sensor activity in any phone ever. (I've attached face unlock video just see it u will be stunned)2. Value for money is 100%. Flipkart charges nearly 14.5k for this phone set. Very affordable price at amazon. Thanks amazon.3. Fast delivery and wonderful packing.4. OMG charging is lit. Charges to full 1.3 hrs (approx).Cons :1. Life not up-to 5020 mah. Even realme 4300 mah phone gives a better battery life than thisNote : This phone has Hello G85 processor so load on the system also leads to a Low Battery life.2. Even though camera is decent, it doesn't look like 48 megapixel camera. All the other features of camera like slow motion etc. are good.2. Over colour blending eliminates the feeling of reality in pictures.Finally verdict : This is a perfect package for the type of people who only want a phone for daily life usage and without heavy gaming (u can game for 3-4 hrs tho but drains battery life)Thanks amazon for this wonderful package."
I am writing this review after 22 daysFirst of all the battery lifeIt takes about 2 hrs to fully charge itWhen u charge for 💯 percent of battery it easily long for min of 1 day on high usageI used to attend online class for continuously for 7 hrs starting from 9 am morning to 4pm eveningIn between i use whatsapp and Instagram often and also used to play PUBG  for 1 hr in between break in evening after 4 i used to listen to music the @ 8 pm the battery will be nearly 15 percent..So battery life good .Next camera  quality of it is goodNext fro playing pubgIt works flawlessly in HD  graphics when went above i have very slight lagOtherwise it's goodDisplay quality is very goodAlso when continuously playing pubg i have abslight heating issue which is common in redmi phoneBut nonthat extentConclusion : worth for money in this money segment .
Phone is good to buy

"Pros- battery is ok, you can enjoy videos and YouTube for a long time easily.- charging is not very fast, but easily can boost battery within 100 minutes.- gaming can be enjoyed smoothly. After 30 minutes you will feel warming but it's always a problem of redmi sets.- look is quite descent.-protective coating is beneficial for daily use.Cons- camera is average.. actually below average.(2.5/5)-network issue."
"after using 2 months no major issue.used light and hard both ways and it work well.not fit for too heavy games for long time.hanged 2 times till now maybe because of heavy use.sometimes heated near camera after long gaming and charging.camera works well, images are little soft.apps work awith 60htz rate and G85 processor were in range.overall a good purchase for me at this price ."
"Just got it Today! Amazon delivered it quite early....Hats Off!!!Phone looks great, can't complain about anything....I'm not really a mobile phone guy, but the phone feels pretty premium. The back looks like glass even though its plastic. 6Gb/128Gb seems like an awesome combo at 13,999/-. Was using a Redmi 4, and according to me Mi phones are pretty rock solid as my Redmi 4 has lasted for 4 years and is still running strong.Really don't care about the processing power, 2Ghz is good enough. Camera takes good and clear pictures, not like a DSLR, but good enough for social media.Cons, I feel the Fingerprint reader slightly lags sometimes. The phone is too big according to me(but its kind of a trend), but its my opinion and I come from a generation where smaller phones were better supposedly.Well then, hope it survives the test of time."
"After 7days of use I'm writing this review for Redmi note 9 Aqua Green 4gb/64gb1) Battery is very good for high & minimal use it will last long for 1 ½day after a full charge.2) Sound quality is very good as well as loud enough.3) Very stylish and decent look not so much heavy.4) Fingerprint and unlock sensors are fast.5) Display is very smooth and clear.6) Front Camera is very good with nice picture quality.7) Selfie camera picture quality is very bad, after selfie the picture seems like smoky dust.8) Speed and processor are good for not a gaming phone..My rate for this phone is 4/5As I'm quite unsatisfied with the selfie camera and mainly the charging takes around 2hr from 10% to get fully chargedMy opinion for this phone is good but not the best as I have thought before buying it."
It's looks good but once after using a 2 days I had noticed that my menu screen is not scrooling and some of the apps are not opening i thought there is a problem and I just switch off and turn on then it is working good. I think it's a software issue . And coming to Amazon service iam aprime user my product has deleverd in 1 day to say exactly I had ordered by 9:45 the next day 8:00 I have phone on my hand thanks amazon
"Average phone. Good for price. Camera sensor is very poor quality. If you take large 48 MP picture, you can see the dead pixels in the zoomed photo. They glitter like stars. Even if you cover the camera and take photo, these pixels come out white colours.Other than that, everything seems nice. I used a program to uninstall all the crap Xiaomi bloatware from my phone, (like mipay, cleaner, micommunity, etc).As a result I don't see any ads.I play asphalt 9, game runs smoothly in playable fps.Processor Helio G85 is same as G80, nothing extra.Mi UI is crap. My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins. Stock android is best.Final thoughts: Good phone to use for 1 year, 2 at most. Price could have been 1k less.Looking forward to buy pixel 4a next year when price comes down."
"First thing is its price under 12000Battery life(5040 maH) is goodProcessor mediaTek helio G85 is betterCamera(back) is best but front camera is not that much goodScreen Quality is good with IPS dot display with 16.58 cm (6.53 inch ) screen having full screen display alsoIt contains 2 nano 4g supported slots with sd card slot in one trayIt also comes with 22.5 watt charger of yype c fast chargingand capable of 9 watt reverse chargingIt weights nearly 200 grams with thickness of 8.95 mm and 161.48 mm heigt and 76.7 mm widthIt comes with Android 10 and MIUI 11 we can update it to MIUI 12It has fingerprint, face,pin,pattern and password unlock securityIn box there is soft case also but it is better to buy another oneIt comes with gorilla glass 5 which is strong but we have to buy tempered glass which gives more protection."
Good Product.
"Good mobile. But some basic app fratures are missing. No photo gallery, no file manager. Over all good product"
"*@ 4gb ram sufficient for average daily life usage*@ As mfg details mentioned as china , think will receive from China 😂 but after delivery Is written back side as Made in India. A good start 😊But on problem is that my phone got screen jammed after a week but ,it's a software problem it is easily restart by holding power button for 2mins approximately.Other no problem overall good 😀"
Good
Design  - The design and edges are so sleek that you will love to handle it more comfortably.Camera quality - Just perfect. The 48MP camera will suit all your expectations. The rear camera as well as the front camera both are a perfect inbuilt feature of this mobile. Speaking about its resolution it very much perfect than expected. A perfect cam for a perfect mobile.Battery life - Even after usage of more than 16 hours the battery stands at nearly 80 - 85 percentage. Just charge your phone the whole night so that you can have uninterrupted usage with long battery life.Voice recorder - It's has the feature of automatically recording all the voice as well as video calls.Speed - It does not hang even when you use more apps at a same time.Just give it a try. A good mobile at an affordable and comfy price.
"I am having both realme 6i and redmi note 9.I must say,always go for note 9.Realme 6i battery is really a shit.its draining more quickly when compared to note9.This is due to its 90hz display.Also there are heating issues while charging in realme  6i.Redmi note 9 is better in camera on good light conditions when compared to realme6i.Moreover realme  6i comes with 18 watt in box charger and redmi note 9 comes with 22.5 watt in box.even though real me 6i supports 30watt charging ,who's gonna buy that 30 watt charger that costs 1,400 rs.When coming into screen protection realme6i comes with an older version of gorilla glass whereas redmi note 9 comes with latest corning gorilla glass 5 (both camera and screen are protected).There are chances for real me 6i camera to get scratches as it is not protected using gorilla glass whereas note 9' s camera is protected with corning gorilla 5 glass.Final words: if you really worry about battery life then never ever go for realme 6i.A feature called 90 hz display in realme 6i drains it battery quickly.Its better to describe realme  6i as 'fast draining phone' rather than 'fast charging phone'.Guys don't believe in reviewers words as they say good review in favour of the mobile company which gives them better amount.Its better to ask your friends who brought this phone rather than watching review videos."
"Overall decent phone within the price Range, Within such price can't expect a good processor, it's not for gamers, overall for Normal use its good...but within 3 to 4 months it starting lagging/ hanging little bit."
"Redmi Note Series is one of the series which we have to trust blindly, but these time Redmi has failed to impress the Redmi note users..Camera Rear Quality is good, but front camera is not upto the mark. (Selfie lover will be disappoint)Battery Life is only one day if you can use heavy 4-5 hrs continuosly it will go down very fast. It is mention fast charging but it will take time min 3 hrs to charge for 20% to 100% , i am very upset about these.i feel slightly heating problem also when i use continuosly 1-2 hrs only for phone set up (not a playing game).Overlall look is good & stylish, touch is smooth,all functions are working smoothly.If you want fast charging & Good camera go for Realme 7..Thanks & Enjoy ..Stay Safe. Be Safe"
Good
it is light weight mobile with good battery and c type charger which is very nice and working properly
Average
This is a good Quality phoneI purchased this phone on July 2021But there is problem in this phone automatically switched off / Hang 3 to 4 times.Can't Switch On.I tried many times30 seconds long press to power button.Then it was switched on..
It is average in performance.
"I was using redmi note 5  before buying this.  This is the latest phone so obviously the features will be better and it is. But the camera images not seems to be better ,  low in quality wise, as the images are little bit cartoonish on zooming ( I don't know whether it's due to high quality images or better display features and I was acclimatised to previous quality ). Performance wise I didn't played any high quality games in either of them but gives better performance on our usual apps .  I bought this under 10k after having some offers and so it's definitely an amazing phone with  this prize."
Okay here goes my honest review I just got this phone today and as expected these phone is looking good .. Back is kinda plastic... LolIF YOURE LOOKING FOR A budget PHONE YOU CAN BUY THIS BUT DONT EXPECT A GOOD CAMERA CAUSE CAMERA IS NOT AS EXPECTEDTHOUGH THE PROCESSOR IS LIT AND AMAZING(Customers who bought this please give a reply about the unboxing ... Cause i've got this with a temper glass kinda fixed ... )Check for the mobiles defects or damages if any place your replace immediatelyIn over all  YOU CAN BUY IT FOR PARENTS AND CAUSUAL USE peoples ..I do prefer real me than redmi (cause I didn't get real me this time also) ⌛So rock on you can buy this with trust
"I brought it on 7 September, 2020 and today is 15 June 2022. Now, I want to share my honest review about this phone.This phone is mindblowing in this range. I'm 102% satisfied (it may be bad for others) because I used this phone in an efficient way and I did a lot of tasks with this phone. I recorded video for youtube channel, I edited video on Kinemaster, I attended my classes on zoom app for one year, I studied, I played Freefire. And one thing, I didn't face any problem. In this price range, I'm satisfied with this phone.1. Its camera is awesome (48MP and 13MP)2. Battery performance is best, charging speed is best.3. No lagging, No hanging problem.4. 4GB ram is awesome and 64GB internal storage.5. I do not face any heat problem in 2 years.6. Face unlock feature and finger unlock is quick and marvellous.At last, I would like to say that if you care your devices and if you don't fill junk in your phone, this device is awesome. Go for it. For me, I'm totally satisfied. In 1 year 8 months time, there is no problem in my phone it is still new."
"I am writing after using approx one year. Don't purchase it as a phone because it's hard to talk with this phone wherever network is little weak. Whereas, all other phone works satisfactorily in the same network strength. This issue is since starting.Camera is also bad even than a Rs5000 phone.Particular this model has many issues. Not recommended to purchase."
Super sound quality and camara quality
"JUST WRITING AFTER 1 WEEK OF USAGE WITH JIO SIM... Phone is excellent scarlet red..Brightness of the screen is very pleasing to the eyes..6 GB 128 GB is working excellent with over 150 apps installed as of now ...  I am not a gamer , I haven't installed any game APPS ....  Battery is charging very fast... Battery is giving me at least 8 hours of screen time for normal browsing & apps usage..  phone speaker volume is very loud but some times with loud speaker sound tone clarity is not there...  Normal phone speaker during call is clear tone clarity...  Everything else is running smoothly without any hitch...ONE THING ABOUT AMAZON ORDERING... THEY DELIVERED IT ON COD ORDER... MY EARLIER PHONE GOT WATER DAMAGED..  COUDNT PAY BECAUSE OF OTP ISSUES...  ALSO I GOT EMAIL ALERT STATING DELIVERY BOY COULDN'T GET MY HOME IN THE AREA & WAS GOING BACK...  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED FROM MY FATHERS PHONE TO GUIDE HIM TO TAKE DELIVERY AT HOME...  I ORDERED THROUGH OTHER SITES BUT AFTER FEW DAYS ALL CANCELLED MY COD DELIVERY WITH INFORMING ME...ON THIS SERVICE AMAZON IS EXCELLENTfirst time writing this review because of this issue...As of now its working great.."
"As of now#This mobile is not for gamersG 85 processor is performing same as G80 and half in G90. It lags, yeah only true gamer knows that.*Poor optimization (May this fix in upcoming updates)*Disappointing fast charging, it takes 2.32 hrs for a full charge (22.5 w charger given but it supports only 18w charging)Pros:*Heating problem sorted out*Descent camera,good looking body*Good battery backup****If u can pay 500 to 1000 more just go for poco m series it's 100% better than this mobile in performance,charging,backup.*****If u r a gamer go with poco m series and realme 6i which is far better in performance and excellent in quick charging.Finally note 9 is not undisputed champion. It's just a champ for household users and for normal usage."
I have been using for 1½ years. Little bit lag but got good features. But lost split screen feature after few updates. I bought it rs 9900. So it worth buying for around 10k.
Picture quality was very poor.
"I am writing this review after a year. Bought the phone  in September 2020.Pros:- low price- Good features- Avg camera although it says 48 mega pixelsCons:- Very heavy. You can hurt someone very badly by throwing it on his head. Causes wrist pain.Lots of Bloatwares- extreme Overheating is happening after the warranty period got over.Overall, most of the reshmi phones are not made for durability. The performance is degraded as the time passes. The company is just increasing e-waste just by dumping cheap phones in India.One must be think twice before buying it."
"Stunning Battery life that performs up to 2 daysafter full charge 100%.Camera Quality is really very outstanding 48 mp  AI Quad camera is efficient in capturing more vibrant ,vivid and sharp picture & videos but the one important  thing that I liked most is its ""video stblization"" .Inbuilt 4 Gb RAM and MediaTek Helio G85 processor help apps in fast processing . I observed no lag in any app till now. I am fully satisfied with this smartphone. Thank to amazon."
Got
Plz don't buy this mobile1-2 month ke baad ye mobile hang hota he waste of money he.Bad Experience 👎
"Liked it very much.Enjoying large screen phone.--Everything is good.working nice no noticable lag or shutters.-- camera good not 48mp but better than other phone in this price.front camera not so good.--performance is nice. G85 is a good processor.--Battery not so good (like 4000mah) and display quality good.Charging speed good its fast.--phone is large but not so heavy and usually its handy.Better for two hand use.--camera bump is normal thats good,protected by case.--overall good phone go for it got it for 11k in sale.Its VALUE FOR MONEY Phone.::If you are satisfied, Like this comment."
"Batery quality good, display ok not very good, fingerprint sensor a little slow, camera quality not good, color quality not match, color over expose, mobile build quality good."
"Everything is fine except 2 things1. Battery consumption is fast, you can use 20 hours with normal use like social media and audio/video2. While seeing any video on youtube/facebook/whatsapp etc. Audio and video are not synced, but I think it'll be resolved with an update."
"*Camera is overall ok , selfie cam is good.Colours are very natural , dont expect too much saturation.Colours r not that much bright but detailing was good.*Screen refresh rate is terrible.If you are watching youtube vdo at 360p it looks like 144p , i m not joking*Overall performance is good , apps are opening very fast as expected.*Audio quality is loud and clear.*Battery takes a lot time to charge , but not draining fast.* Screen size very huge , i mean in hand experience is not good.*"
Nice cameraavergae cpu  gpubattery very less . It says that it is 5020 mah but it does not feel like that.very quick battery drainage.FAST chargin is very bad for this phone. It overheats every time when you charge due to fast charging. PLZ after 15-20 minutes remove the chrger and let the phone cool down.overall 3.5 out of 5
"It is a good quality phone but , I want to share u some points u should know while purchasing it.1) it is made of plastic , so easily gets scratches.2) it has gorilla glass protection in front glass only.3) processor and display and battery good but it take huge time for charging .4)camera quality is very good but at some times not so good.5) over priced , should be around 10,000rsBecause they had not provide any protection back and the charger given doesn't charge speedly even my old motorola charging is faster.Conclution - u can go for it if ur budget is around 12k"
After using 6 monthsVery heavy weightVery slow processerBad quality cameraHang AlotTouch is very badFingerprint sensor is very very bad
Product good low price
Redmi note9Surely it can be better if it had a Snapdragon processor in it but According to my personal usage mediatek is not so good for long term usageBattery life-Phone's battery life is pretty good and the fast charger makes really difference at this price range a phone is comming with such charger greatCamera-Well According to me personally it's not a camera oriented phone so you could nit depend on this for pro photography well the camera is also not that bad and selfie camera is also goodProcessLook and feel is nice it's juat like note9pro and looks great in handOverall not a long term phone
"Some times screen is blinking and a white colour type of horizontal line appears on the bottom or top of the screen while using the device. And heating problem persist while using for some time. This type of problems will not pesists in any other models of xiomi. All others features and functions of this phone is good but for the appearance of one problem makes a model bad which makes customers discouraging and disappointing before buying this model of redmi. So i feel that solve this problem as soon as possible because it is a newly launched model of redmi. So, be smart and be safe."
Please do not buy this mobile always have network issue .better buy vivo for good network and Internet
Really good choice under 10000 rs.Processor -5/5Display- 5/5 ( full hd very brightness)UI -5/5 (too many options to customize)Speaker -5/5Call quality -4/5(in built call recorder)Back camera -4/5Front camera - 3/5 (only low light)Battery backup and charging time  -4/5 ( backup increased by  changing some display option) FM radio - wireless and back cover quality is also  very good.Thanks amazon to provide valuable things..
The media could not be loaded.
"This phone is good, its look is the best looking and the front camera of this phone is very special, the rear camera which is 48 mega pixels, the camera is a bit too fine, it is not very special and the functions of it are fast.  And the storage memory card of the phone is not full 64 GB and the storage is 51 GB, according to me, this phone is a bit right, it is a bit expensive at 11000, after seeing everything according to the phone, ₹ 11000 is too much."
Good Mobile
Mobile bahut haing hota h 10-20 minite me reper hota h
"i bought this phone in amazon prime day sell and it took around 10 days to arrive, now the pros of the phone i only notice good battery life,sound and screen quality but cons are it took almost 2.30 HRS TO full charge then what is the use of 18w fast charging comes with 22.5w charger its completely waste and the camera quality is also normal it does not looks like that you take a shot from a 48mp camera so if anyone is thinking of high quality snaps then dont buy it you can buy it only for its battery life and screen quality"
"I trusted xiaomi because of redmi note 5 pro after that i thought mi phones  are awesome but this phone this note 9 is ok not  so good camera is ok, sometimes times phone glitches  I don't why ,even phone storage is not full,Main problem - while calling phone light gets off & never gets on until other side person cut the call . I am just sick of that.Even pocket mode is off too."
"Redmi note 9 phone review after 1-month use.Pros :Build Quality is good.48 MP Camera quality is good.Sound speaker is crisp with good bass.MIUI 12 update is received.We can rely on it for a long time.better than any realme phone.Cons:MIUI has too many bloatwares.MIUI 12 is showing some frame drops.No Audio Enhancement software is installed like Hi-Fi, Dolby, or DTS.Default Equilizer does work for Bluetooth devices.Macro lens and wide-angle lens qualities are worst, looks like cheap camera used.MIUI is showing too many ads."
Ok so lets talk about the main pointsPerformance:- Good...not lagging for app openings or heavy usageCamera:- Quite Good and decent in the price pointBattery life:- Fully Satisfied with the life of battery almost i can use one day with one time chargeCharging:-If we are seeing the capacity of the battery then the charging is fast for 5020mah it is quite fastCalling:- Mic input is great and speakers are awesome
"Back is good, but it has to have a cover otherwise the scratches and fingerprint n dust will make it old in one day. Camera is just good but not like 48 mega pixel. Slow motion doesn't work. Proper review will come in a week on YouTube channel, ""Perceptions Filmz""."
"I m not satisfied with the box it was dirty like black fingerprints was there in the box, and the battery life is good but i feel like something is wrong in this phone after i used for 1 month the phone  started hanging . And whenever I try logging in any apps there is another number already been written which is not mine i feel like they have sent me used phone so please Amazon check well before u deliver it because it maybe done by the sellers not by Amazon so i request you guys please check all the products before u deliver to customer thank you."
I liked the value this offered for the price.Only complaints I have battery life is not great when the dual volte is on.Data Speed is poor when the dual volte is on.Significant differences in data speed and battery life when the dual volte is turned off.Though camera offers good performance the slightest motion can cause a good amount of motion blur in artificial light conditions.
I dropped the phone 3 times but nothing happened. Very Very Nice Smart Phone.Buy It.
"Hi friends, this is hemanth from Andhra Pradesh, REDMI note 9(4gb+128) is good and I like all REDMI Note series bcoz I like to use different costom Roms and root so its perfect for REDMI notes so I have purchased it, all good butWho loves PUBG plz don't go to this variant its hangs much and lags much I think bcoz of 4gb ram, go for 6gb ram,Before this I had using Asus zenfone max pro m1(6+64) its super 3years no lag and hang in PUBG its very smooth."
A product worth buying.
Very Good
Good
"It's just been a day since I'm using redmi note 9.. camera is good ,battery pickup is good but the adapter which I got was made in china...If the adapter could be changed then it will be of great help by the Amazon.. and it's a quick charger not a ""fast"" charger.i.e. It takes 25mins to give 12% charging"
"Got mobile under 10k, all function are good, go for it but with common UI and ring tone, optionally u can change it."
"Voice over call is worst , last 15 years first time facing this issue in these mobile.Also camera is average.Better to choose samsung or other device."
The mobile is a good one and the colour (Arctic Blue) is really cool. The device works good. I have gifted it to my wife and she is happy with the set. The camera is also a plus point.
"Nice Mobile in this range. I love this phone.Nice battery backup.Nice camera,Pictures quality is excellent, fabulous...I love it...Fingerprint reader is working very nice.After all I love this product. I advised you to buy this product. It's amazing."
"Pros-Good budget phone with this price segment.G85 processor in 10.5k price is quiet good offer.Camera is good overall(ultrawide,macro,zoom)Yes there is gyroscope (for pubg players)Cons-Oversharpening pictures in cameraIts just a review after using it for one day so cant tell more about its consOki bye"
"I was anxious and uncertain about the features of this device.... but after receiving, i found this a good product from redmi at this price range...This is my 3rd phone from Redmi..features are good  good camera, reasonably good battery backup though the charge doesnt long for more than 36 hrs after full charging.....you have to set the camera to 48 mode to get sharper pics.. night mode is also good.... Only shortcomings I find in this device is  its a bit heavy and mild heating issue...."
Mobile Not Switching ON
"As expected, it is another beast from redmi....'Fingerprint reader' is superfast and fabulous'Battery life' is disappointing and is below expectation....'Camera quality is superb....The battery life is decreasing to much lower extend when I am installing and playing games in it....'Ram management' is awfully.....can't even recall 3 latest apps and I have to open the apps from the begining.....Overall good but need some improvement.#STRICTLY NOT FOR GAMING PURPOSE....BUT RECOMENDABLE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THAN GAMING"
Bettery backup is not upto the mark as expected from 5000 mAh bettery.Camera is decent but don't buy it for camera.Display is good.Overall this phone is value for money under 11000.
It is so hitting and battery e that within 3/4 hours
I have 2 devices from redmi 1 i am using it since last 3 year. Still good in condition. Good performance. Good camera. I use it for photography as well. Affordable.
Battery is very good but camera is not like 48MP. If you buy around 10k. The phone is satisfied.
"Review after a week of usage-> Good battery life, i'm getting 2 day battery life(scrolling through feeds,chatting,2,3 hrs of Spotify,1/2 day of netflix).->Takes up to 1hr for full charge-> stock camera quality not up to mark, adding gcam could improve it.->Good sound quality, front speakers are excellent too.->No network problems.->Running on miui 12, hopping android 11 will be available soon.->No stuttering while doing casual tasks, i cant comment on gaming experience since i haven't done any till now"
I am writing this review after 9 month of usage. Slightly lagging in performance may be of 4gb ram I am getting so go for 6gb ram. Sd shot is useless its not supporting if u want to view sd folders u need to restart ur phone. Front camera is useless when u put full temper glass. Back and wide angle is good. Worst processer in this model games are lagging and phone got heat quickly so go for snapdragon. Battery life is not expected we have to charge twice a day after medium usage.
Wow
Better product
"Camera Quality not up to the mark, hanging issue also seen initially"
Good phone in the price range. After 8 months of use I can say this is value for money. The camera is not good during the night and the sensors other than the primary camera and 48 MP will seem useless to many. The best thing about the phone is the hold and the look of the phone. It is quite slim and not too heavy. Good for gaming or watching long videos as well. The back is sensitive towards fingerprints and scratches.
"I hope I wouldn't need to edit my comment if it's too early or after I am more experienced with the mobile , but using it for few days after purchasing it recently I would say that it's a beautiful phone with a brilliant display quality and size , faster performance and a more than satisfactory camera quality , not to mention of its huge 128 GB storage capacity. The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it. You will not even find many Google apps in the pre-installed app. Besides that you will be consuming your internet data faster with this phone , you know that."
This is good phone at this range and have some pros and consPros1) Good UI2) Screen display is good3) very fast charging4) Selfi camera is good5) face unlock is very fast and good.6) back cover comes and goodCons1) few apps are preloadded and unnecessary but we can remove them. you will get 50 GB out of 64 GB2) Battery life is average3) Camera quality is average not expected to 48 MP.
"I liked the productI am giving the review after 33daysRear camera-9/10 it is amazingFront camera- 7.5/10 it is decentOverview -10/10 its damm goodPerformance- 9/10 i play Freefire and its amazing lag free experienceBattery - 10/10 Amazing my usage is 10-11 hrs and still there is 20-27percent battery leftScreen quality 8.5/10 its goodRam Management - 7/10 its ok , it only keep last six app in background and after that the aap restartsInhand feel - 10/10 Good but its little bit wideCharging - 8/10 takes 2hrs. But it is ok u have to charge only once a dayLag free experienceValue of money -9.5/10No heating issueU can go for it"
Still Note 9 is best at 10k even in 2021.ProsDisplay - Full HD+ BestBattery - goodAverageChipset - Good enough for regular useConsMIUI - very bad (but you can clean few)Camera - Strictly Average
Overall the phone is best . 🔋 + camera
"It's very decent to use. All the features are good. no complaint about that. But the battery doesn't feel like 5000mAH. If you use it continuously throughout the day, it will drain at the end of the day."
Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge. But charger support 22.5 watt..
"battery performance not be good ,camera quality one year good and after 1 year darkness total camera,fingerprint reader only six month proper good performance and after six month not be capture fingerprint reader .redmi mobile phone regular use in one hours video after one hour heating"
I like the phone's camera structure its looking so good and also the camera quality also excellent but one thing takes ne badly that the network problem it often changing from 4g to 2g automatically and the battery is not having the capability of 5020 mah if you continuously using phone it will drain in just half of the day... otherwise its an excellent mobile under 12k....Thank you
"To be honest, I didn't like the camera at all.. the phone does give a good battery life and comes along with a fast charger, The gaming performance is great , but honestly Camera section is disappointing, it does offer 48mp,and bla bla bla, but end of the day it is a samsung sensor coupled with Helio processing, if the camera performance optimization is not done in the coming upgrades, the Camera of this phone would probably the worst hit ever."
"Everything is good , but only problem is the front camera comes little dull and dark when using Google Duo calls ."
"Positive parts1. Performance is best.2. Multitasking3. Screen display4. Protection5. Sound6. CameraNeed to improve by xiomi (negative)1. Unwanted app and banned app is still use in this like clean master, etc must have remove option or fixed it with update.2. Price is little on higher side.3. Why not given 90hz refresh4. Colors availability5. Night photos not up to the mark.Overall good phone. unwanted app must remove by manufacturer as guideline by govt of india."
Very nice phone in that budget good camera quality  can be zoomed till 10x which is the best feature  I liked in this budget
"After 3days of use I think redmi note9 is awesome features likeYou get dual app like bhim,Google pay,phonepe app.This app have dual space one is user mode another is guest mode.I review 3 basic feature which is battery,screen,and camera1.battery performance is great .Full charge can run upto. 14-16hrs2.screen is little bit disappoint me Dot display is not good one.3.camera is just like 13mp rear camera and 5mp front facing camera."
बैक कैमरा क्वालिटी थोड़ी कमजोर है। सेल्फी कैमरा शानदार है। बैटरी लाइफ बहुत अच्छा है। फिंगर प्रिंट लाजवाब है। कुल मिलाकर इस कीमत पर ये फ़ोन शानदार है। mi 9 power से तुलनात्मक रूप से ये फ़ोन अच्छा है।
"This device got a supreme battery life as the display quality looks so far awesome , g85 will do your all task and moderate gaming , fingerprint is so fast and accurate all times , rear camera setup is awesome."
"Like:- Decent camera quality, great multi tasking ability without being delay or any lag, best battery performance of almost 1 & half days with moderate  to heavy users.Dislike:- UI is not clean & full of bloat wares. I came from Stock UI which is clean & have a smooth functioning comparatively."
Fhd+ screen at that price is really bonus with G85 processor is good enough for the binge watch.. comparing to other brands. This was the two factor which made me to purchase this
"Display is good as it offers a full hd+ display but it's a 60Hz panel so scrolling smoothness is average. Back camera is ok , it has a 48 mp back but look like it's only 16 mp and front camera is not good , pictures are little bit blurry in selfie mode. Performance is average as it comes with helio G85 which is quiet a decent processor, no problems in daily usage and normal games like temple run, subway surfer but when it comes to heavy games like call of duty and PUBG, the performance is not good...too much frame drops but considering the price point it's great, network connectivity and wifi connectivity is good, battery backup is great, it's easily gives 1 and a half day of backup."
Nice 👍
"It's working fine, functionalities and qualities is what you can expect from a mid-range budget smartphone. The only issue is with battery, I didn't expected it to drain as faster."
"i loved the phone basically at the price  point of 15000rs.....it has a very good battery backup and everyone in the review is saying bad speed of charging...............no it charged 50% in 20 minutes..........i played for continuous  for 2 hrs nad it didnt heat a bitgames i played--1.cod mobile, modern combat 5,asphalt 9, free fire, standoff 2, assassins' creed identity at high and ultra and i got 70 fps in all games and 55 in asphaltcamera is good but selfie camera has a bit more contrasti bought 6/128gb so i didn't face any problem or lag and I've bought it for gaming so go for itI do not lnow about the4/64gb so if u want to buy for games go for 6/128gb"
"Really good mobile in this price segment. Mobile is really good.  Wonderful  camera. Only battery is taking longer time to get charge. But that is okay.  Otherwise  speed, display, camera is  amazing. I am a big fan of MI  phones. This is my 3rd mobile, i selected Mi phone.  And  happy."
All is wonderfull good fingerprint sensing timing average camera
Minus point is we have to pay additional cost for headfone. Somewhere I am dissatisfied that complete accessories are not coming with this model.Not happy
"I purchased this phone sometime back for my mother. It has fulfilled all the expectations. Features, especially the Camera, is very good."
"Nice & great product , I'm happy with it ."
Very poor video quality. It is not clear and sound quality is substandard for this price. Total waste of money. Oppo is must better.
Good
GOOD phone i like it..
Not so good.
"Things I look for in a phone-Rear mounted finger print scanner-1080p display-Minimum 4/64I had a lenovo k8 note before this. Although the specs were matching, it was just a pain to use. Moving back to the xiaomi ecosystem for now.This one meets all the requirements and is better than the lenovo in many aspects.+ I exchanged the lenovo for this one and got around half the value of what I paid for the lenovo (purchased for approx 7500, exchange value was 3800) so a great deal overall."
A good smart phone at lowest price.. But as usual redmi phone have some heating issues.. Overall a good smart phone for normal commitment and good for gaming too...
I like it
This is really a grt phone...I've used it for more than 6 months and its amazing! Its camera quality is superb!
i again made a mistake....thought Media tek has now doing something with their processors....but again it proved me wrong...Snapdragon processors are much better guys...some good points1.Battery is awesome ...its back is great on standby2.camera is ok ok.Not natural colours its over saturated3.Look is acceptable at this price rangenow the only bad thing is1. its processor ...although it is clocked at 2 ghz but this phone is definitely not for gaming purpose.even clash of clans is not wrking smooth forget pubg.for running pubg you have to on the game turbo and still game lags a bit ..frame drops are very high sometimes.....so guys its upto you ...never trust a media tek processor for gaming...and specially under 15 k phones...........this is my review after 2 weeks.....after the first system update all the above issues have now been resolved....battery optimisation for stand by is now awesome......and biggest of all...pubg runs smooth without game turbo..i am happy now ...peace
Awesome deal i get from Amazon phine is super cool colour is awesome in 11k this is the best phone i received thank you Amazon
Battery life is poor. Also it takes whole day to get charged. Heating issue while phone is in charging. I would not recommend this phone at such huge price.
Worth buying
"This is best budget smartphone , but if you wants to buy it in 2021 then i would say don't because it's now old model"
I looks so good and nice design at all ... performance also better and camera quality is good then battery life also good
Here my product review after usage of 3 months.Cons:If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.Macro camera - useless featureFront and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.UI is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.
Using wright now as well and battery phone screen everything is good
for the budget of under 12k this phone is very descent phone with very good feature and specification . i am fan of stock android but this redmi interface is quite different apart that i had huge issue in software issue where phone turn on night mode after 6 pm without turning on the option still mode on . again i changed os going to service center hectic
Fingerprint quality very good but camera ok type
I took this phone two days ago. Happy with its battery life and the performance of sensor. But it's quite big in size and camera is not that good . Still I will recommend you if you have low budget
I will say overall it is a good product. But i camera should be more better according to this price. And the processor is slightly slow than normal phones in this price range. You can surely go for this if you are taking for home use not for playing game and all because it is not at all a gaming phone it has heating issues you phone starts lagging. So for normal use only
"Hi. I bought a redmi note 9 phone. From the first day, problems with the camera began, I turn on the camera application and it turns off, the lock screen turns on. Sometimes I turn on the video after 2-3 seconds it turns off, I turn on the video again, it can turn on immediately, it can work for another 2 seconds and turn off again.​ The phone is 2 weeks old."
"3 months after purchase there was a gap in the cam and my microlens was filled with dust.so when I wanted to have a repair through amazon it was too late so I request the provider to cross-examine if there are any gaps. now I don't use my microlens for the camera but with other cameras, I am just moving on."
"My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely."
"this is a great phone for both normal use gaming and productivitypros:1)great design even though the back is made up of polycarbonate material feels premium and strong2)no hang issues so far very fast3)videos are colorful and vibrant4)1080p display is very good and feels like a amoled display5)touch feels good6) charging is super fast and battery backup is goodcons:1) the main issue is that the banned apps are preinstalled like secuirity mi browser...etc2) camera is not good as expectedoverall conclusion is that, buy this phone if u want a premium phone on a low budget but if u can spend a couple of thoousands go for its higher versions like pro and pro max and maybe samsung as well!!"
It hangs a bit. But good at this price. Camera is above average.Battery is good last for a full day even if one uses it whole day
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Good phone at 11k price range.Camera is decentdisplay is really good qualitybattery is niceyou can watch the unboxing video at my youtube channel named Techy HrikJust search on youtube""Redmi note 9 unboxing Techy Hrik""The first video is mine"
Good
"BEST BUDGET PHONE IN THIS RANGEBATTERY LIFE IS VERY GOOD, when unpacked, the beast had 60% alreadyLESS BLOATWARE is nice thing with the Android One & MIUI 11 but I got instant MiUi 12 so very happyIt is very slim & very big easy to hold & gives good grip but menu is inaccessible sometimes because its very big phoneIn the box they gave pin a fast charger usb 3.0 & plastic transparent cover as well. It also has nice screenguard without any printings on itVery impressed by looks the glossy back makes it looks rich & royal. I am suggesting it for you guys go for it"
"Overall the phone is very good, it is a great multitasker, but due to the processor i guess pubg mobile lags a lot it is not smooth, the graphics were great but not the gameplay and in my experience the is not able to cope up with battle royale games like pubg mobile, brawl stars. It has a great camera the battery life is very good and with a fast charger."
"Very Nice Phone with beautiful full display. I have bought 2 sets with different colours, pebble grey & arctic white. Although, it is not grey from anywhere, else it has bluish colour and arctic white is moreover shaded blue rather than having more white. Still, both the colours looks great. Happy with the battery life. The back cover inside the box is also of good quality.  It's worth buying money."
Simple phone for simple people.....not for gamers nor for camera users....ok ok
Writing this review after using 02 months. Camera is good. Battery is good for moderate use. All other features are normal. Nothing extraordinary.However display is little weak. Facing difficulty of using this phone outside during daytime. Issue is more prominent if need to use in outside environment in presence of scorching sun.
Battary performance not good
Overall phone is good but front camera quality is not like 13mpIn 10999 it is best device but for camera you can also buy another device
I bought the green one but theyDelivered the white but white is more beautiful than green I am so happy with the product screen is very smooth and battery is also good but if we compare vivo and redmi same camera 48mp vivo is best this is also good but there's a very difference between only the companyOverall phone is excellent and so simple to use and sound quality is 👌🏻
"The most reliable & best phone in this price range.. i ordered 2nd note 9 for family day today use... just go for it. 👌🏻👍🏻Not any issue.. everything is fine battery, display, camera & etc.."
प्राइस के हिसाब से बहुत अच्छा है पर थोड़ी सी कमी है बैटरी लाइफ थोड़ी कम है और कैमरा सेंसर में थोड़ी इंप्रूवमेंट होने की जरूरत है मुझे यह फोन अमेजॉन great Indian festival sale mein 11000 rupaye ki kimat mein Mila camera is ok battery life below than expectation everything is ok but processors need to be improvement. और डिलीवरी बहुत अच्छी थी डिलीवरी डिलीवरी ब्वॉय अच्छा था.
The packet containing  Redmi Note 9 Mobile received  on 15/08/2020.The following items were missing 1) Sim Eject Tool 2) Warranty card. 3)Clear soft case. I request you to  send the  above missing items  . the product is good  so far .The user guide is printed is in very small  fonts and difficult for a senior citizen to readSebastian Alummoottilmob 8075454894
"For that price range they providing 48MP, but using low quality lens getting low quality pictures.Remain ok...ok. if you get it for 9k - 9.5k price range ok to go"
Front camera is averageNot good
Not bad
"The phone is overall goodOne thing that annoys most is preloaded app **it's not stock android**Although camera is great mainly primary 48MPELSE ALL THINGS ARE DESENT as in any other phone of same price rangeGlossy feel of back is premium,but as most of times it will be covered ,you will forget about it in mean time"
Good but there is a problem in getting network... I have been using two phones my mi phones works perfect but my Samsung has a problem... It is not only me but my friends are facing the same problem.. All the hostelet who are using Samsung don't get strong network where the rest who are using other phones use the same network without puffering
"After using this phone almost one year I feel it is value for money camera quality, speaker quality, display, keypad touch, screen is good almost after 11 months now it reboot anytime while taking call using any app or writing any mail which is quite embarrassing."
Battery life is good... Camera quality is also good in this range
"Minus 2 for mishandling the newly launched phone, Amazon Delivered my phone before time , after i opened the bag i found damaged box, there was a mishandling while shipping, i was affraid to open the box, seal gum seems repacked, finger print arround both the seal, i proceded to return from app, then got call from Amazon, executive told me the seal is fine and open the box, i open the box while she was online with me, she also assured me that i have 8 days to return, use it and if found anything wrong, we will take back....inside  Phone was ok, but packaging was not so impressive, lets hope for best, phone is awsome, Arctic white looks so rich in hand, girls go for it... Surprise to see that phone is MADE IN CHINA. i thought it is coming from Indian factory."
"Redmi note 9 : finger print touch is excellent ! And that's feather touch screen is brilliant but ,The battery back-up wasn't good as the price ratio, it have been 6000mah battery it good, but this  device desopoint me! So all over product was nice as the price criteria , 🙂"
I am happy to bye  redami  note 9Thank you Amazon👌👌👌
the fingerprint sensor doesnt work everytime. the camera quality is very bad i doubt that this has 48mp camera.. The phone got slow after couple of weeks so not soo good..
The phone is big...the Color is not white...it's a graded colour of upper white and lower sky blue..doesn't suit for people taking serious jobs...it's funky junky...the case given is transparent if u don't like the colour u can put a coloured case so that no-one can see it's colour...I still haven't figured how to add space between words while messaging and adding contacts
Decent budget phone
Face unlock is not good. Even the camera quality will be below par with the expectationsI also played game on it and it becomes hot just after 1 game.
"Today got the phone and except for slight heating, everything seems good. But still don't buy chinese phones. I had to buy it because ""mai gareeb hoon"" ."
Writing the review after one month of use✓Good camera quality✓Super battery backup✓Brightness of screen needs little bit improvement.✓charging time is 2:15 minutes✓Overall you can buy it
A good phone in this budget ....camera is not very good but if we consider budget it is fine ....battery life ks awesome...so overall aa good phone
Good

Nice product
Good mobile for under 15000 rs . processor is better than other for gaming.  i played bgmi very much good
"The Redmi Note9 is indeed a very impressive phone, with the latest Android version and fast processor. I found the features are at par with any top brands such as Samsung. The user interface also is very simply and easy to follow. The battery life is excellent and the highlight is the camera quality, it definitely captures astounding images, I found the camera quality even better than an iphone.Also it has many in built apps direct from the Mi Store and loads of additional features. The screen is big enough to watch videos or gaming.Overall highly recommend this phone."
Received the product on time even in such tough times ....thanks to Amazon for that..As far as product is concerned it works good as of now...
"My experience after 6months:Gaming  : I'm not a gamerMulti tasking : GoodHeat  : No issues upto nowOnline Video : GoodBattery.  : GreatProcessor  : GoodUpdates.  : Bad, Only one Security updateCamera.  : GoodDisplay.  : GoodMy overall recommendations to buy: 7.5/10"
Amazing
"It is a fantastic phone for its price. It has good haptics, fast fingerprint and face lock, great display, good connectivity, miui12, great service across the country and a great back too. Some might say that add 1000 to your budget and buy and get realme 6i and then again someone will some add another 1000 and get samsung m21, as it has a bigger battery and a AMOLED display and this chain keeps on going.So just buy whatever your budget lets you too.You'll not be dissapointed.And remember ""It's not that the good phones have got cheap. It's the cheap phones that are now good."""
A great option. Camera quality is super good. A must by option. I've been using it for nearly 3 months and I never felt like I wasted my money on something non worthy. Audio and video quality is really good and you even get inbuilt editor for audio and video so no need of downloading extra apps for it. Easy access to all features like screenshot screen order etc. Even you need not have to download screen recorder too. It's already present in this version. For me it's really a great option and hope my review will help you too.
"Really good Phone. Used it for over a month. Battery, Display, Camera, Storage, everything us perfect.They have also given a transparent cover free 😁Finger Print senser is perfect.."
"I am reviewing it after using it for 6 months* Camera - 48 MP quad. But so so much good. Same in the case of front camera also. So so. (2/5)* RAM - they claimed to have provided 4GB. But even when I open a 600 MB game while merely 1 app running in the background, the phone starts lagging. Very worst RAM. (1/5)* Battery - For the first month it was going great. But now a days, I just play 40-50 mins of games, & use Instagram for 30 mins. Except that I don't use my phone much. And for these usage I am to charge the phone twice a day. (Generally I charge it when ever it reaches below 50% of battery)So, overall, it's just an another phone by Mi.My rating - 2.5/5."
Good
Nice phone value for money
"This product was nice. It has a great gaming performance. Camera quality is average. Finger print sensor was not good, it was slightly lag. No battery draining problem while playing games, after 1 hr of continues playing it has slightly hot. It has a great battery life. I brought this phone at 10999 price range . I think it was too bad at this price range but I am surprised this phone is extremely good at this price rangeI am not struggling with any issues of this phone there weren't any issuesThe delivery man was so good person"
Very nice phone in this price segment all features are good and reliable.I suggest this phone is better in this price range.
"Battery not lasting longer in normal mode you have to switch to dark mode, also sound is a concern, has to be full volume to hear properly."
"Gifted to my sister,Delivery was too fast, packing was nice.Note 9 is good for those who uses phone less, not recommended for gamers and heavy users. And also not recommended for the selfie lovers.But I am happy bcoz my sister is happy, she is not a selfie lover or a gamer, this is the reson she likes Note 9 much.Thanks Redmi."
"Nice phone by Xiaomi,I'm still using the phone and it is in great condition,good battery backup , playing games is fun in the phone,big secreen and fast processer...thank you Amazon"
"Finger print reader and face recognition is very fast and goodBattery back up lasts for only 1day on normal useCamera and picture quality is just above average, don't expect for professional photographyRAM speed is good all apps work fastOverall a good handset to buy in mid segment range, you are getting sufficient features for your money."
"The phone is fast, the charging is average. The camera is pretty good but your opinion may be different because I was previously using a 16mp camera phone"
Best product for homeschooling students and this e who are new users. It's a great combo and manages every tasks vet well . The helio g85 chipset is almost equivalent to Snapdragon 712 . If you are a student and buying a new phone it's the no. 1 preference. Please don't listen to those who say this isn't a great phone . Believe me I have used it. Now if you are planning to play games more than 2 or 3 and pubg. Hours then not only this phone but flagship phones will also heat up a bit and lag. Take care of the phone and this will be of great choice to all.
Good phone in this price... No complaint after using over a month period... U can try it.
"Redmi Note 9 is a line of Android-based smartphones as part of the Redmi Note series by Redmi, a sub-brand of Xiaomi Inc., first of all, I was amazed by 5020mAh Fast-Charging Battery & 22.5W Fast Charger in-Box which was a need as  I hat charging my phone frequently, and secondly, the camera 48MP Quad Camera Array, With Ultra-wide and Macro Lenses was a great touch......"
Phone is good but need batter more good
Nice phonebut camera performance is Not like 48 MP1st delivery phone was damaged with camera quality after replacement it was improved little bit but Not like 48 MP of note 8  camera performance of redmii note 8 id better than note 9If you are expecting much clear camera so don't Buy itFor gaming this phone is best
"This device is totally worth the money if the performance is not considered,  as MIUI is heavy for a Processor like MTKG85. Battery life is the best in this phone. Fingerprint sensor is smaller than the last models. Camera is normal."
Good
"Yesss, You can buy this. ❤️Just two bad things Heat and more Heat when you play games. 😂Rest is Better than others at this price. 👌"
"Camera while taking videos has big issue (bug), you will see video and audio mismatch when you record viodeos , battery life is average and has overall average kinda performance , Xiaomi could have done it better in this range of product."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Aotu contact Fire stick to YouTube.good display & good look.battary is perfect for long time use.camera is medium quality.But under 15k ok.All useful short cut added.Mobile coming with front & back side protecting guard."
"Post 10days usage, I must say: Battery lasts over 2days with a single charge(I being a moderate user), though it seemed to drain faster in the first 1/2days.Camera quality & phone-look is pretty decent; speakers are also good enough.However the Touch-screen could be improved by being a bit more sensitive, especially around the corners of the screen.Smooth performance overall. Truly a budget-phone!!!👍"
"Review after 5 monthd of usage. Charging is not that mach fast. Its charging time is similar to B type charge port phones. Performance also not up to the level. Its like 4 GB RAM speed not like 6 GB. Battery life is little bit satisfactory and now my mobile display gone. If you are using the mobile continuously then display will gone, thats what happened to me. Not suitable for long time use."
"Worst phone ever I have selected, big lag in performance, for clicking on tools to open calculator it is getting stuck. Worst.."
"Overall very good phone under 11k, however phone weight is much. Battery life is very good, camera is ok not that much good, performance is good. Worth for money."
"This mobile is awesome , superb screen , and camera is good but camera settings is less than in samsung at times it gets heated up while charging or if we use the mobile much , other features and all is good . worth buying if u are a gamer . Aqua green is much better colour than blue ."
The camera quality is not as expected but okay. Battery life is great.
Superb budget phone
Normal use
Perfect choice
Nice package good phone good camera long lasting battery
Phone work's Exiclent starts of year latter it works slow
It's good
Considering the price range its a good buy
Excellent phone with HUGE battery best camera fastest fingerprint. BUT main problem is with os it is LOADED with ads other phones in this price range have UFS2.1 but this phone has EMMC5.1 which is a little degraded one but dont tell me that 5 is a greater number than 2 but overall very exotic phone
It's good in speaker and mike to speek battery is good in working but it's to late to chargeCamera are good enough but in low light it's not work as in havey light videos are not good quality to see 480p only 720p and 1080p are good that much reselution of display is there.Good mobile for the money
The product is ok for light use onlyExperiences delay on opening apps and also framedrop is also an issueBattery life is greatCam quality is great in day light condition but not upto the mark during low light conditionsGo ahead if you're a student or a light user who's looking for a budget dealThankyou
Good delivery I am happy this Amazon working delivery process
"Everything is good in this phone. This phone is meant for normal games not for heavy games like pubg but u can still play it with little lag. This phone is good for multimedia usage like streaming youtube, movies, Social media etc. The soft case provided with phone is not in good quality. Flash light doesnt works properly while wearing cover on the phone."
"Bought this mobile for 8900(after exchanging redmi4+hdfc10%. I went for this mobile because of its price and the better features compared to others. delivery by amazon is satisfactory .overall, the Performance of the mobile is decent. battery is good .performance, display and camera are okay due to mediatek processor. I would recommend this mobile for its price, features, service(previously had(redmi4)"
"The Phone that I Bought Came at similar price as the redmi note 9 pro 4gb/64gb variant on paper redmi note 9pro has has a better processor and Alexa built in. But even with the same camera redmi note 9 pro has better picture quality(My nephew has redmi note 9 pro). Because of the software. Also AR is Not supported, most of Xiomi's devices got Android 11 but this phone still lacks."
Purchased for online classes for childrenUser-friendly InterfaceLong battery life

Good product worth the price. But fast charging is not fast as compared to Vivo V201
Superb
"Very nice product in quality and performance,.It's very helpful to make easy to all day to day work"
Battery life is good.
Working fine from six months. I m happy with purchase...
"My take on redmi note 9...1. Beautiful handset.2. Beautiful camera.3. Battery is decent. Survives 3 days at normal usage.4. Very fast. Processor is very good.5. Charging time is almost same like other phones.6. Screen is very bright. And colours are sharp.7. Fingerprint scanner response is quick.8. Seller Darshita Etel is trustworthy.In a gist, this phone is premium, it contain no cheap hardware material and contains everything I need."
"Spending this  much money not worth i feel for normal user..Wifi and hotspot gets frequently disconnected ,Disconnect of data and voice (VoLte ) if you you get any call  during internet is connected over hotspot or wifi, Hot spot  @ 5 Hz does not show up not sure why it is given. if it does not support. or any future planper day with normal usage kids playing game and on you tube, at least  2+ time need to charge and gets over heated .if we are out door for  funtime, it may not support may be carry a power bank of 5000 mh.48 MG camera is good but does not have zoom more then 10xdoesn't impress me"
👍
"It's upto markAll features works well, except -1. Front camera is not that good.2. Phone is bit heavy - will be more heavier with cover and glass.Otherwise1. Back camera is just fire.2. Battery backup is boss - it's a power bank3. Quick charge.4. Display is pro.Go get one."
Phone is nice in this budget. Overall performance is good. Front camera could be better

Average product.. it's ok that's it
Good
All over it's good phone
Amazing phone kindly buy it if you have low budget..
Overall I feel average
The phone is descent in its 11 thousand price. But in ten thousand it is a best deal. The camera is very good I am satisfied with its camera. Delivery is very fast it delivers it to me in just 2 days. The performance is very fast and it handle 3 or 4 games easily. The fingerprint scanner is working little bit slow but ok. Overall the smartphone is very good
Mobile is soo good in this price range it's really value for money but camera quality could improved little more like when I was capturing a subjects face it's making the face looking fake like kinda oil painted that could be improved and performance is really good in this price range
"After a use of 12 days.Fingerprint reader nice.Camera quality average.Front camera okay,not that good.Once fully charged lasts for a day with normal use.Batgerh performance average .Many inbuilt apps.Good features.Display is good.Excellent look"
"The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G which is surprisingly powerful for this segment. You also get a 5020mAh battery and suppport for 18W fast charging. The Redmi Note 9 Pro is powerful and everyday work will go smoothly. The display is large and crisp, making games and movies look good.👍 But the sound quality is less.I got that issue in my phone.For the price, the 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera also does a decent job. We were quite impressed with the camera performance of the 5MP macro camera results that are super detail-oriented."
"MI always provides earphone with its phone. Here the earphones are not provided. On MI website, earphones were given with the phone in same price."
Battery charging time is too longDisplay quality mediumFinger print sencer not work properly
"I like it for its battery life,and design & dislike it as an issue found in this phone sometime a sensor not work,when i press power button ,some time display was not running properly, when switched off or reboot it then work properly,plz  check that issue.."
"Phone looks good with some decent configuration for the amount, I would not recommend if you are primarily choosing it for photos or videos because quality is not as expected it'll look like a painting if you zoom and so much of pixel breakage.No matter what ever pixel they say camera is not good"
"This is my 4th Redmi phone, I used 3s Prime, 4x, Note 7 before this. I would Suggest use kapaver Cover to protect phone. Note 9 is much lighter than Max Pro or Pro or Poco. Handy phone low light photos not good otherwise is it really good phone , better battery, light weight, screen also good. Mine is 128 gb with 6 gb ram, so speed not an issue. I m not Gamer, but MS teams MS outlook, dual whatsapp, Twitter is regularly use"
Budget phone in this price under all specifications but camera quality may be increase..
Redmi not 9 is good device on this price and it's a lot of features on inthis price. It's coming with a four camera setup and front camera is a mini punch hole camera on top right side on the display. Redmi not 9 is powered by MediaTek Helio G85 processor and it's a large battery 5020mAh
Its very excellent phone great camera and loud clear sound quality
"I personally told this by using it for 3 months,before this phone i have a realme 6 in same price and i used it for 2 year and never saw any problem but this phone have no good ui and battery capacity, camera is average..i personally told u go for other phone.."
"Good in built quality ,. Camera is very good in day light but in night it goes very bad. Selfie camera is very bad in both day and night ,it produce warm pics just like red it make me sad. Performance is quiet good. Xiaomi has to improve camera just like note 7 pro."
Video and audio did not sync while doing a video recording
It's a great phone if you're a normal user i use this phone around 9 to 10 hours with one time charge and it's battery life is quiet good if you're looking for something which is in budget and has a good hardware thisnis the phone.
* My choice would be more storage capacity and more RAM and more ampere battery.** This is why I bought this product.  But this handset  ram more but it is running very slow.  Storage more than 50%  is still empty.  I am unhappy using this product.
Very good battery backup and most importantly the camera picture quality is super clear and natural.
Nice product 👍👍👍😊😊👍👍😊
Everything is fine.Color's of camera images are not real. They appears dark
It is the combo the best camera processor
Love this product 😍
Not fast charging its take 3 hours to full charge I received bad charger  but by power bank its take 2 hours Kahan ham 22.5 w fast charging. Kahan to ma ha tha  1ghante me charge hoga  fon  good but charger bad aur only one day battery life redmi note9
Best phone in mid range prize.......
1 month use is nice redmi but rate high
As we know what Xiaomi uses to deliver in its lower segment smartphones. Ordered it for my Maa and she loved it. It brought a big smile on her face and that's what matters the most.
"Product is good, working fine,,,,, it is an exchange offers inwhich I was exchange my old mi Y1 . Delivery boy taken 300 rs for exchange."
As always this offering is also a good altogether package from Redmi.Writing this review after 15 days of use.It lakes only in camera department for me.I am not saying that this camera not worthy.its just okaish.main drawback for me is its form factor.its is a big and chunky phone.
I bought this mobile on 27 oct 2020 till now it is working too good....I charge it once in a day and then I fully use mobile at the end of day atleast it have 15-20% of charge....camera is quite good not better than oppo but its okay here i mention the selfie camera...Edit : (23/07/2020) after use for long time it heats to a moderate lvl...lots of times finger print sensor becomes mad...plus an important stuff this mobile doesn't even show my Sd card while all other mobiles read it (inclu redmi 9 A)
Super
I gifted this to my friend and he really loved this item
"Fingerprint nice, battery life awesome, camera quality good"
"It's a one of the good collection of mobile It has fingerprint reader, good battery life and decent camera."
Good
Only 4 star because of heavy weight and some time camera not working properly
Nice phone. Good camera quality. Superb video editing option.
"Note 9 One of the most popular phone selling in India is superb design, its nice specification looks very nice"
Awesome . Value for money.! You all purchase this product without fear.Great 👍 I want to bye once again.....
It's have been 2 months i'm using redmi note 9.The fingerprint reader and face lock are too good. Battery life is average depends on use. Camera quality is not to good because in light camera works good but at night it not works so well and front flash is not good . The phone gets hot after some time of using .But sound quality of the phone is super. And the other thing is good.
I love this mobile. Best phone under normal people budget. And best feature available by Xiaomi
"Average phone. Although the mobile package was sealed and not broken, the amazon packaging was open, someone must have opeend the packaging before the delivery."
"Awesome product, Camera quality fantastic, battery is awesome. Amazon's honesty is good here. Only one problem is there that is the headphone jack point is at very odd or wrong place."
"I'm writing this review after using it for 6 months and it's ok but if the price was 1.5k less at that time then it would have been better.Display is ok.Battery is ok,I can use it for one and a half day.Camera is not exactly upto the mark.Performance is average.I would recommend it if u want a corner punch hole phone and since there r better phones so I think u can look for other phones with better specs."
"After 15 days use I am writing this, over all phone was nice,display quality,camera, battery was good. Phone was little bit bigger not able to fit in the pocket, there was a issue in screen lock, there was a sensor problem phone was automatically unlocking without finger print & security lock."
Good product
"Average product with good battery life. But even after using 6/128 gb phone, still there is hope of improvement in software sometimes it lags while opening the applications. Camera is also average. Even poco m2 pro 4/64gb at the same price is giving much better photos."
Mobile heating problem while using internet
Good
Today mobile phone lag and it is not operating now purchases date 13/06/2021Lag date 04/07/2021
After using it for two weeks writing a review....good phone at this price......but battery life stays for morning till night ..for those who uses internet fully whole day....and another thing is if too many apps r opened it sometimes hangs though that's very less....but overall it's a nice product.
Xiaomi claims made in india but received totally made in chinaUnwanted system files one is chinese lang. Written seems to be un secure.If u want to take risk u can buy becoz ph is good. It supports only 18w charging only xiaomi is misleading.
Over all performance is good. Camera quality is not at all satisfactory. It could be better
Performance is better and need to camera quality.
Quality products good battery backup
Overall phone is good for gaming or normal uses not for heavy gaming
Good mobile
"Redmi needs to fix UI bugs, overall good"
"Fingerprint sensession is goodBattery life very goodCamera quality excellentValue of moneyOne problem found required to be rectifiedAfter connecting head phone a minor problem was arise for few days for several times ""Do not covered the head phone area""."
Around 10000 budget this phone good one..no issue past 7 months..night mode camera only unsatisfied..
Front camera should be in the center.More over in all the phones the front and rear cameras should be placed in the. Center for better picture clicking.
Camera performance could be better
This is the best phone in this range all functions working good Mi is the best service provider
The phn is this price range so better' camra and battery over all so good
"Pros - battery life, processor, displayCons- weight is on the higher side."

I Tottaly Liked This Product According To The Budget👍
Good phone but unnecessary cheaps  third class ads makes the MIUI horrible(hope you understand).When will MI stop such ads?? Govt intervention is required to regulate the ads pushed by these smartphones cos.
"Battery life is good and can easily last 1-1.5 days with daily apps usage like google pay, linkedin, fb, amazon, google apps. All social media apps functions smoothly. It can run games like pubg as well, but experience is not too great. However, its good for a student with limited budget."
"Redmi Phone all over the best for battery life it's know everyone, I am useing this phone first time Redmi Note -9 really it's battery life and camera quality Super. I love'd this Redmi phone. I like phone design, Very very lovely. Thanks,.. Redmi and there maker,s you all are best. Thanks Amazon for providing me."
"Dispaly is good, camera quality can be improved"
Best product i got in the best price
Phone is goodBut this phone battery life it's not good just because this product not working for 24 hours after 100% chargeCamera features and functions as a goodAll features are good but only for battery performance is low
Featured mobile
Good purchase but exchange was not accepted by delivery person
"When i'm using youtube  and watching videos , automatically play store opened , after 5,8 minutes again opened"
Almost this is a good quality phone in this cost.Charging speed is slow. It doesn't support 22.5 watt
"Good quality product,value for money. Impressive camera quality with a perfect selfie camera as well,bettery is good too. Over all very much satisfied with the deal. Amazon delivered it on time and the delivery person was very well behaved. If you are looking for a phone within 10-12K then go for it,its perfectly fited at this price segment. ❤️ MI"
Few things to know about this phone .1 very good camera setup specaliy the 48 MP2 Very good gaming experience played Free Fire for 40 minutes was working without any disturbance .3 very good battery power lasted for 1.5 days stand by on fully charge.4 Very good inbuilt feature given by Xiaomi.5 the latest software was very usefull for the phone gone really very smooth.6 very good sound quality.7 all the biometric sensors are well working and quick responseWOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE

I like this mobile
"I like it. If it is little thiner, it will more beautiful."
I like it... I buy two for my son and nephew
"Camera just bad ,but mobile is good in 💸 money"
I like this product. Finger print reader and battery life is excellent. Back camera is excellent. Front camera quality is good.
"This is very nice phone, cam is good also battery... Like it👍"
Fingerprint reader so first .The battery of this phone takes 2 hours to fully charge.  Battery lasting 10 to 14 hours.The camera on the back is very good but the camera on the front is OK
It is exactly what you would expect from a Redmi device. Not that great but it won't get any better at this price. Camera is great if you know how to work with raw images. Battery is reasonable. Not that bright display but okay.
"Good phone with a very reasonable price. Camera quality is good, Battry life is also good.Must Think of going with this phone in this range."
I purchased this phone on 2nd Sep 2021 and have been using it since last one and half month. Camera quality of the phone sucks and pics captured really don't look like captured on the 48MP quad rear camera. Front camera is also not good and quality looks like 5MP instead of 13MP. When started using the phone performance was Ok but after a month of use performance has degraded a lot and the phone response is really slow even if you have just 2 to 4 applications running. Not a good phone so stay away. Was having lot of hopes from Redmi when I purchased it but all screwed up.
It is a nice phone.battery performance is nice....but display touch is a little poor.....I loved the look of phone ...but while using snapchat and changing the filters the screen does not changes fully ...I mean there are places where the phone can't edit....properly....although there is a little problem in display
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Battery  back up not to the  add. Mark
"Fingerprint reader & face unlock is very well still after one year. Battery of mobile survive the day. But the charging speed of mobile lighty  slow, camera quality is getting useless day by day"
"Good looking , best for phtographi , battaery just ok,"
"Battery life is not so good, but overall mobile is value for money"
Nice 👍  but camera 📷 quality achha Nahi lag humko
"After 10 days using this phone,Battery life is too good, according to chipset G85 performance is good, ram management is good, Screen FHD+ is good, But Camera quality slightly less 48 mp primary sensor but it should be improve through update ,  overall it's good phone to buy"
The product looking good working fine except the sum tool kit application. It will through error every 2 min. To overcome this we have to install. New app for this
Nice luck
"All over phone ia good if you want to use cheap and best.Good camera ,battery and response"
I using this phone  1 month this is true review● Average performance● average battery life● fingerprint work perfectly● calling quality is good● Front camera is waste and back camera is good
Gaming mobile
I really love this n feeling good indeed
I liked the product. It's very good and I would recommend it to buy.
Camera is absolutely perfect but battery life is poor
Best mobile under ₹9999
This issue not only affects the phone camera but also most of the social app cameras too. The audio leads the video by a few milliseconds or even seconds and shows a really horrible outcome. Switching off and on the phone fixes this momentarily but the issue comes back quickly after only a few uses.Truly saddening to see a good phone have such a bad camera issue...
Good camera quality
Very nice 👍👍
"Worthy for 12k, camera resolution is low, don't expect too much camera quality compared to oneplus, best buy for normal usage.Satisfied: Buid quality, display quality, battery stands up to 2days, speed, no heating issue.Dissatisfied: camera quality and resolution especially front camera, Mi shouldn't pre install unwanted Mi apps."
Mi phone is always unlimited features in low budget. Thank to Mi
"Phone is very good in this segment .It is good looking phone.Camera,display and battery performance are the main features of this phone .In the starting it take average 1-1.5 minute for one percent charging but above 90% charging it takes average 5-8 minute for each percent charge."
Good product in this range.. same as expected
"Good, product is most satisfied. We are happy for this  product"
"It's fabulous smart phone this prize range, i used properly of 2 moth good work"
Awesome and nice product

Best mobile but camera quality is decent.Best for gaming
There is only one mistake.... After some day the mobile start lacking... Please solve by update...camera is best
Okay
Nice phone
Processor is not very fast  phone give you all rounder performance battery is good
I'm rating 5star because Amazon won't show 1 star reviewsThis phone has serious heating issues even when its in Idle state. Camera quality is very bad don't be attracted for 48 megapixels it's not worth it. The images are grainy and not good quality. In short DON'T BUY THIS PHONE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. AS AMAZON WILL NOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT THEY WILL PROVIDE REPLACEMENT WHICH IS BASICALLY USELESS BECAUSE YOU'LL GET ANOTHER UNIT OF SAME DEVICE WHICH WILL HACE THE SAME PROBLEMS.
Superb

"I've been using this device for last 3 months. Redmi note 9 never disappointed me until now. It's giving me the expected performance.Having a good battery life, and 18w charger is quick enough.✅Camera quality is fine, very nice when compared to some other brands 48mp cameras.✅Good gaming experience, pubg running without any lags.✅Nice display. ✅I would say, don't expect beyond it's limits, you'll find this device worthy on all aspects."
best budget quality phone. in offer i purchased this phone in 10k. thnks amazon  for provide a great deal.
Like battery backup very much.
Nice
"Bought this mobile couple of months ago, but as note 10 launched a couple of weeks before, describing this product is meaningless. Just buy note 10 or m12 or m3 if u look around 10000rs. By the way its a very loveable mobile. But u dont get samoled display,so no aoa , and has 5000mah battery no 6000mah but has 23w fast charge. Descent camera,fast fingerprint sensor."
Got it in 9749/- if u want to use big aaps like pubg go for power
"I am fan of mi products but suggest to go through these before buying. transparent pouch which is not suitable for camera protection.chance of very quickly scratch on camera.worest camera only 12mp instead of 48 mp.(exact after 20 days i got these issues-U tube voice is toooo low,while seeing youtube no sound increase or decrease. Once mobile screen suddenly switch off even switching on also not open for 3 min.most important one is while calling phone is hanging for 5 to 15 sec."
Good. I bought for 12500 but in the showroom it's just 10k only so I'm quite dissatisfied with this purchase. Coming to phone it has superb features.
Good
"In this budget the fingerprint reader is awesome, battery life is good but backup provide 1day full after charging 0 to 100%, outdoor camera quality is best but outdoor camera quality is not best from the other handset..for normal use it is best"

"Battery  good  , but  some problems with fingerprint reader"
"Too many Chinese apps keep pushing you to download more and keeps popping up notifications, not the option to delete the app, even after disabling app notification the notification still keeps popping up. But the hardware is good if bloatware doesn't bother you then it is for you."
Redmi Note 9 is better than Note 8 in terms of camera battery & display sizeBut Helio processor is quite negative than Qualcomm Snapdragon processorFor ultra gaming better opt for SnapdragonVideo making also better in SnapdragonOverall Ratings 7.5/10 :) worthy of money
"Superb, go for it, very nice phone, I got this in exchange offer."
Bad battery.

Super
Nice..
"This phone is best for under 12000 range . If u have a tight budget. 48mp camera is good .For normal users it's good.Battery life is wonderful . Also, display is better than  realme narzo 20 , where u can only play upto 720p videos. Here 1080p is also viewable.Also, back cover and tempered glass is already provided. So no tension for that also. Overall 4.5 stars."
Very nice
Good 👍
Mid range durable phone
Overall Everything is of very good quality and there is just a little heating problem but not too muchThe camera is awesome and it has good features
Everything thing is better then redmi phones expect camera
Over best at this budget ..

Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it’s a Piece of shit.Kindly don’t buy Becoz it’s worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that’s all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don’t buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.
"The phone is pretty good according to the price. Bt their are some loopholes. Color composition is not so good, front camera is not so good. Fingerprint sensor is pretty fast. U can play pubg without lag nd heating for hours."
"Writing review after using 2 years ,it's a legend.Battery life is awesomeGaming also good for 1and half year after that it's hanging and heating i am a heavy gamer of free fire i am satisfied with this thanks redmi"

Which is really a issue.Camera 48mp is just for numbers.Display is good.Battery life is good.Body around the mobile is delicate.Finger print is fast.Sound is baddest of bad.. worst... leastNot easy to handle with 1 finger.Useless apps of MI  preinstalled in mobile..we r unable to delete them.Heating problem"

Good phone at this price range . But if you want a camera phone then don't go for it . Battery performance is good and charging speed is average.
"Overall the phone is good, only the camera is not so good as advertised, battery is charging quickly and draining of battery is less than other phones. One can go for this phone."
The product is good 👌

This mobile selfie camera not good
Nice product just purchased last week and struggled to get this note 9 as there was lots of people that are trying to get and waiting to join even waitlist. We will provide the details review after a month use.
Amazing phone ...good storage long battery life valuse for money go for it..
After using 9 month ....phone performance is very good
"AT A PRICE OF 10,999....THIS IS A GOOD PHONE....BUT NOW AT 11,999 YOU MUST GO FOR THE REDMI NOTE 10....HOPE XIAOMI ROLLS OUT THE ANDROID 11 UPDATE SOON FOR THE REDMI NOTE 9....ELSE IT'S A NICE PHONE YOU CAN CONSIDER IN THIS PRICE SEGMENT.....ALSO THE BATTERY LIFE OF THIS PHONE IS JUST AWESOME."
Phone will best suite for moderate users for Camera was just my opinion. Rest of all the features are cool. Too Many ads on the screensaver which keep popping up continuously even after disabling them may be Redmi can start working on disabling them. I will still prefer it to be best budget phone with too many features at this price range that no other phone can beat.
Just a awesome product in low budget
Ok
Great phone in this range
Product is good but camera quality ok ok
Good
Good product but need optimisation as after miui 12 update camera is not upto the mark otherwise battery backup is superb its quite good for multimedia consumption because of its fhd+ display Hope Xiaomi will optimised ASAP
very good nice quality of camera
Front camera do not fulfill expectation
Simply Great Choice in Budget
In that budget  very good model
Working smoothly and battery lifetime is also good..
"Superb in speed display is big,sound quality is excellent, feature of its are very nice,bacttary performance is really good,but camera is average that's why I give four star out of five.But according to reid mi note 9 price compair to other mobile in this price I really prefer redmi note 9 .Good one and I specially thanks to amazon for providing this products on no coast emi through different finance thank you amazon."

As per price mobail is good
Nice product for this Amount
I have exchanged my previous phone redmi note 7s for this phone. I got it for 10500 and it is a 5-star phone for sure. The best is the gaming of this phone and the camera is also very good.  All together you can go for it. The exchange was also super smooth by amazon I must say. Battery is good and fast charging is also very good.
Good
"Great phone within this budget , I purchased this phone under 10000 during festive season.Battery quality is good , my observation that its run all youtube videos when network is even poor whereas other phone do struggle when poor network. You can go for this . it takes less than one hour to get full charge ,battery back up is  more than 5000 mah.no heating problem"
Self camera was not good
It good
"Over all the mobile is pretty good at that cost but the mobile takes nearly 5 hrs for full charge & 30 minutes nearly for 10% of charge, it's little weight except these the mobile performance is nice......."
"Very nice mobile in the price point, durable and realiable."
Love my redmi note 9. Farbolus design style specially back camera. Thanks amazon for timely deliver. Front camera could have place in middle never the less best phone under the price as I purchased 4gb 128 gb under 13.5k.

Its features are good but the only thing bothering me is the apps and storage. There are so many useless apps which I don't use at all and the phone won't allow me to delete it!I checked the storage and I found out that the useless apps all consume almost 20 gb of my storage! My phone only has 128 gb storage but I can only use 110 gb storage. Please do consider this............

I have bought the mobile during the month of July and I am facing lots of issues like hanging on the same page, slow internet, app icon disappearance, hotspot not visible in other devices. Also, I have contacted Redmi Customer support not satisfied with the service. Its like namesake service to solve out complaints. No service center wants replacement they just recommending us to change the mobile OS, even there is one year warranty."

I like this product.all things are good but I'm not happy with it's front camera & charging speed because in the box we get 22.5 Watt charger but it support only 18 watt charging speed ⁢ front camera also not take prefect shoot in night. I request to redmi please improve it charging speed & camera ⁢ requires many major update . Then I required this phone others wise if any one buy then Wast your money .so redmi please improve it

Phone bought 1st week of July. After update phone got hanged. Speaker volume and quality not very good. Camera ok.display ok for the price.
"Pros: full HD display,long battery life,good looking design,reverse charging, Widevine L1 certified for HD viewing Netflix n amazon primeCons: fast charging isn't 22.5w and no update fixes this issue despite charger supplied being 22.5w capable,camera is average but better than others in this price segment and definitely not for night shooting,cpu lags in almost all taskConclusion: go for pro version of redminote 9 or realme 7 @15k ,at 15k not worthy of price"

"After 7 days of use I'm writing this review: It takes a long time to charge and heats up a lot, sometimes it lags to pick up incoming calls, many mi apps are still pre-installed in the phone(even after update they weren't removed), only the  camera quality is good, honestly it's better to go for other brands in same price range as they offer better performance."
I like  mi redmi
"First of all it has all the unnecessary bloatware and ADS that come with MI phones.Other thing that I dislike is the camera and overall performance.Positives ,However are its battery capacity and incredibly loud speakers .Give it to your parents and they will not regret"

In this price range phone is completely best only charging adapter charged slowly.
"Camera quality could be a little more better,otherwise all is good only problem is there is heat produced while charging in mobile body"
The phone is a good one but not true value for money.Camera is good and same as all xiaomi devices in this segment.Speaker sound output is quite low (not suitable for binge watchers). You can only hear dialogues when set to full output.Does not easily fits into hands.Processor is  good. No lags seen so far.Overall a good xiaomi buy but keep expectations low with respect to speaker volume.

Plz don't purchase this model it hangs in just one month of use and I don't think it's upto 4gm ram when in use...I prefer the previous models were much better. And efficient..very disheartening and unsatisfied. Cam is too bad
Display quality is pretty average.  Brightness is too low for watching movies and TV series. Color saturation are not that great either. What is point of full hd display if company can't provide good brightness. I have used other mobile phones and they have much better display quality. Battery is good though.Camera is average. Don't expect much from it. Be careful before purchasing it as there is no return option available.
Wow phone
Best value phone at this price range
this product has is just amazing. with lots of features . camera quality is just awesome with 48 mp back cam and 13mp front cam. this phone is really gaming master. it carries many apps. and the very important thing is this product has a very reasonable price. i recommend the hesitating purchaser u can buy it without hesitating. this made my online studies even more good

I like the colour and camera but it is really irritated when its beem and regularly notify not to hold mobile from headset connection.. too many times its hang. And a lot of internet connection when u have a less apps. Plz guys do not buy it.  Its a brand new product but most of times its hang

Majorly camera is a disappoing in this mobile. We can not take videos with 48 mp camera. Also 48 mp camera is not as expected it's just a little better than 12 mp camera.
Awesome phone but I would like to say that there is a problem with #MIUI 12 as it has many bugs but Xiaomi has informed that they will bring an update soon so if anyone is buying this phone do not upgrad to miui 12 because it is a beta version so I suggest everyone to use MIUI11 And download when all the bugs are fixed .
